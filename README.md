# LunaJuice

A tool to subdue and monitor suspicious processes.

[Documentation goes here](https://github.com/Aurillium/LunaJuice/wiki) as updating this file requires a PR and I can't exclude it.

### Looking for downloads?

[Check out GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Aurillium/LunaJuice/actions). No releases have been built yet and none are planned currently, but the latest builds in each PR and in main will be automatically generated here.
